    <li data-dbid="1"><strong>BMW M4's</strong>
        <br>
        <p id="car1">The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. Part of the renumbering that splits the 3 Series coupe and convertible models to the 4 Series (to further differentiate it from the 3 Series), the M4 replaced the M3 Coupe and Convertible models. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4-Series include: a very powerful and responsive, twin turbocharged engine; improved handling, suspension, and braking systems; aerodynamic body enhancements; interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M" (Motorsport) badging; the significantly reduced weight compared to the standard 4 series and its predecessor with an all-new stiffer chassis and extensive use of carbon fiber, especially the roof of the car.</p>

    <li data-dbid="2"><strong>Mustang's</strong>
        <br>
        <p id="car2">The Mustang created the "pony car" class of American muscle cars, affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks,[5] and gave rise to competitors such as the Chevrolet Camaro,[6] Pontiac Firebird, AMC Javelin,[7] Chrysler's revamped Plymouth Barracuda, and the second generation Dodge Challenger.[8] The Mustang is also credited for inspiring the designs of coup√©s such as the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri, which were imported to the United States.</p>

    <li data-dbid="3"><strong>GTR's</strong>
    <br>
    <p id="car3">The Nissan GT-R is a 2-door 2+2 high performance vehicle produced by Nissan, unveiled in 2007.[2][3][4] It is the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, the name having been given over to the R35 Series and having since left its racing roots.</p>

    <li data-dbid="4"><strong>Supra's</strong>
    <br>
    <p id="car4">The Toyota Supra is a sports car/grand tourer that was produced by Toyota Motor Corporation from 1978 to 2002. The styling of the Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[2] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and began just calling the car Supra.[3] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. First, second, and third generation Supras were assembled at Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation Supra was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City.</p>
